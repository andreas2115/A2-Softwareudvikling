AI Citations and reflections:
ChatGPT is the tool used. 
AI generated code was never copy pasted into any part or section, but it is citated some places where i used the help directly. It was used to figure out how the Assert commands in the NUnit.Framework worked for my self made tests.  
AI has been used for code clarification and reasoning as well as syntax qestions,  
in the same manner as how you would use/ask a TA for help. 
ChatGPT was used to help setup the correct structure in my own test module, to be able to run tests while developing.
All code that is not citated is self written and developted.
